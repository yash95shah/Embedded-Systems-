--- In the second part of the assignment, two drivers need to be created performing the same functions that were performed in the first
    part of the assignment in the user space.

--- The first driver is the ledspidev which deals with the display of LED and SPI. It will consist of the following functions namely init,
    open, release, probe, write and ioctl (used to set the patterns in the device buffer).

---The driver for the distance measurent has been called as usonicsensor which consists of the functions open, release, init, exit, write 
   and read.We make use of the irq handler to detect the rising and falling edges and after that we make use of the rdtsc again and ultimately  
   calculate pulse width.
    
---The main program (test program) prompts the user to choose the type of animation he wants. We have made various functions corresponding to
   type of animation. The first animation is that of the dog which was already shown in the user level, the second would be the distance-number
   in which the number counter increases/decreases (0 to 99) depending on the distance, the third just normal distance sensing and the last would be a 
   user designed function to display the word 'INNOVATION'.

-- To execute these functionalities, first go to the directory and type in the linux terminal 'make all' to generate the kobject files. Run the
   test program. Select what type of animation you want.
